# ðŸŽ¯Type-checking for 'Primitive' JS Types

[![License][license-badge]][license-url] [![Travis CI][travis-badge]][travis-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-badge]][coverage-url] [![Commitizen][commitizen-badge]][commitizen-url]

Type-check for 'Primitive' types in JavaScript are always something to take care when receiving/sending a payload from/to Server/Client application. If you ever wonder how to do this you can sure use `typeof` and make the check by yourself. Or you can user ðŸŽ¯`js-is-type`!

The usage is simple and verbose. The tests has full coverage and you can use without a doubt.

## Available Types

- `isArray()`
- `isBoolean()`
- `isFunction()`
- `isObject()` (_Remember: in JS, Arrays are Objects!_)
- `isString()`
- `isUndefined()`

## Installation

`js-is-type` is available on npm/yarn:

```bash
$ npm install @codevor/js-is-type --save
$ yarn add @codevor/js-is-type
```

## Usage

### With ES6/import

```js
import { isArray } from '@codevor/js-is-type';

const names = ['Alice', 'Bob'];

isArray(names); // => true
```

### With require

```js
const isArray = require('@codevor/js-is-type').isArray;

const names = ['Alice', 'Bob'];

isArray(names); // => true
```
